NAO App is based on https://github.com/JimM58/ciq-ble.pi CIQi Pi App.
CIQ Pi App is also menioned at https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/b/news-announcements/posts/would-you-like-some-raspberry-pi-with-your-connect-iq

I have used skeleton and all of the BLE features of CIQ Pi App to build NAO App. Credit for CIQ Pi App goes to Jim Miller.
